"Damn such a great phone. Camera is really good, battery lasts long enough, super smooth even though its just 60 hz XDR display. Videos with action mode on are insanely stable and crisp.The night mode can take some really good shots jn low light conditions .The whole apple environment itself is so seamless. I shifted from android to iPhone and it barely took any time since I had iPad and a mac already. With a just a few clicks the phone was ready to go.",5

"iPhone 6S Plus 64GB -> iPhone 12 128GBMy 2nd iPhone, upgraded after 5 years.Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took...",5
Awesome Love it,5
"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it.",5

"Switched from Android to iPhone and this transition was really smooth due to its easier GUI. I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn’t waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black. Attached pics for the reference.1.OLED Screen is good but by default its much of a warmer tone.You can disable the True tone option.Dark mode is lit 🔥🔥2.Battery 🔋 lasts a day with Wifi ,location and Mobile Data on.

"I've been using the iPhone for seven months now, and I want to share my thoughts, especially if you're thinking about switching from Android to iOS.First off, I really like this phone. It performs better than any Android phone I've had. But there's a learning curve, especially if you're used to Android, because there's no dedicated back button.In my opinion, this iPhone is best for people who use their phone for work and don't play a lot of games. It has some nice features, but it doesn't...",5

"Best iPhone yet.Coming from regular 13 (6.1 inches), I noticed some significant upgrade. It took me 10 days to fully get used to this new size which is not heavy. And now this plus feels so normal & actually perfect size for me 😄. For those wanting to try new stuff with iPhone, just get this size and its weight easily compensates for its large size (if that ever becomes an issue )Display : More vibrant with better Dynamic range than iPhone 13 (noticed this very quickly),ProMotion (I tried ...",5
